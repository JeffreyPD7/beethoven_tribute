                                <h3>Ludwig van Beethoven (baptised 17 December 1770 â€“ 26 March 1827) was a German composer
                                    and pianist. A crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras
                                    in Western art music, he remains one of the most famous and influential of all
                                    composers. His best-known compositions include 9 symphonies, 5 piano concertos, 1 violin
                                    concerto, 32 piano sonatas, 16 string quartets, his great Mass the Missa solemnis, and
                                    one opera, Fidelio.</h3>
                                <h3>Born in Bonn, then the capital of the Electorate of Cologne and part of the Holy Roman
                                    Empire, Beethoven displayed his musical talents at an early age and was taught by his
                                    father Johann van Beethoven and by composer and conductor Christian Gottlob Neefe. At
                                    the age of 21 he moved to Vienna, where he began studying composition with Joseph Haydn,
                                    and gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist. He lived in Vienna until his death. By
                                    his late 20s his hearing began to deteriorate, and by the last decade of his life he was
                                    almost totally deaf. In 1811 he gave up conducting and performing in public but
                                    continued to compose; many of his most admired works come from these last 15 years of
                                    his life.</h3>
